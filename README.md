| Project | Short Description | ROSE-AP Repositories |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| ARP | The proposed solution aims to achieve high flexibility for automating the processing of flat workpieces. In order to achieve this goal, the system has been designed to manage different parameters of the sanding process, which are not tied to a particular model or brand. Workers will be able to choose the correct combination of parameters for a certain type of material in relation to the desired finish and, based on that, the system will automatically configure itself <br/> [ARP Concept Overview - Short Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQqg1zUhGk0 "ARP video") | [Trajectory Generator](https://github.com/visionequipment/arp "ARP ROSE-AP") |
| Cobitt |  COBITT aims to support companies that manufacture multi-layered composite and synthetic-material products, through laminate stacking and forming processes, by catering to a fully automated and agile manufacturing process.

| FlexMill | The main part of the FlexMill project was the development of an automated tool provision process for machine tools by an autonomous mobile robot. The software for that robot can be found in the section “AMRControl” and is specifically programmed for the Protobot V2 from DALMA Robotics. Furthermore, the industrialization process including 3D modelling, drawing generation and NC code generation for adapter end production was automatized. The respective results, which are described in the ROSE-AP repositories, can also be downloaded for this purpose. <br/> (TBD) [FlexMill Concept Overview - Short Video] | [Overview](https://github.com/flexmill/Start-here---Overview "FlexMill Overview") + [AMR Control](https://github.com/flexmill/AMRControl "FlexMill ROSE-AP 1"), [CAD/CAM Automatization](https://github.com/flexmill/CAD_CAM_Automatization "FlexMill ROSE-AP 2"), [Machining Centre Server](https://github.com/flexmill/fiware_connector_machiningcentre_tools "FlexMill ROSE-AP 3"), [Broker Console](https://github.com/flexmill/Fiware-databroker-console "FlexMill Tool") |
| Gridiron | There is a need to automate and optimize production processes in the manufacture of biosensors and auxiliary electronic materials to reduce costs and false negatives in diagnostic tests. In this regard, there is a growing trend in investment in solutions that detect production failures in increasingly robotic biosensor manufacturing environments. GRIDIRON project deals with these issues and aims to detect and prevent potential errors in circuitry, electrodes and vials used in testing. <br/> (TBD) [Gridiron Concept Overview - Short Video] | [AI Backend + Microscope and Pipette Robot Servers](https://github.com/AIRInstitute/Gridiron "Gridiron ROSE-AP") |
| Innowest | The Innowest project addresses the manufacturing process of metal structures and parts manufacture and assembly of products made of metal components. The problem solved is the robotization of the process of polishing and welding parts used in various products such as those intended for the food industry, the automotive industry, construction or furniture, etc. <br/> (TBD) [Innowest Concept Overview - Short Video] | [Multi-process data broker](https://github.com/manioanadrian/Inno-West "Innowest ROSE-AP") |
| Mediscara | Mediscara aims to support small and medium sized medical equipment manufacturers in two major application scenarios: (1) agile production and quick modification of parts, and (2) traceability and documentation, which receives more emphasis as the new EU medical device regulations are getting closer to taking effect. Two separate robotic cells have been developed by the tech provider for the abovementioned challenges. One laser cutting workshop cell for agile part modification and an electrical checkpoint for automated quality inspection, labelling, marking and production tracking tasks. <br/> (TBD) [Mediscara Concept Overview - Short Video] | [Manager App](https://github.com/ppuska/mediscara.manager "Mediscara ROSE-AP 1"), [Master Control Unit](https://github.com/ppuska/mediscara.mcu  "Mediscara ROSE-AP 2"), [PDF Generator](https://github.com/ppuska/pdf-generator "Mediscara ROSE-AP 3") |
| Oscar | Oscar is an IoT application for enabling communication between an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a robotic arm assisting the operator during the assembly process. Main modules of Oscar are: (1) CSV Parser, a component in charge of loading the data of the components and processing steps on Fiware.
